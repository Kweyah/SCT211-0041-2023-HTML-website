<h1>My Favourite Recipe</h1>
<h3>Rice for  one person</h3>
<section>
<p><h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ol>
  <li>One cup of rice</li>
  <li>2 cups of water</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
</ol></p>
</section>
<p><h4>Instructions</h4>
<ul>   
    <li>Rinse the Rice:</li>

 the rice in a fine-mesh strainer or sieve <q>Kichungi</q> and rinse it under cold running water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.
Measure the Water:

For most types of long-grain white rice, <b>the standard water-to-rice ratio is 2:1</b>. So, for 1 cup of rice, you'll use 2 cups of water. If you prefer slightly firmer rice, you can reduce the water to 1.75 cups.
<li>Boil the Water:</li>

In a medium-sized saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, bring the water to a boil. Add salt and oil if desired.
<li>Add the Rice:</li>

Once the water is boiling, add the rinsed and drained rice to the pot. Stir briefly to ensure the rice is evenly distributed in the water.
<li>Simmer:</li>

Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with the lid, and let the rice simmer. Do not lift the lid during cooking.
<li>Cook:</li>

Allow the rice to simmer for about 7-10 minutes. Cooking time may vary slightly based on your stove and the type of rice you're using, so you can check the package instructions as a general guideline.
<li>Check for Doneness:</li>

After the cooking time, remove the pot from the heat, and let it sit, covered, for an additional 3-4 minutes. This allows the rice to steam and finish cooking.
<li>Fluff and Serve:</li>

Using a fork, gently fluff the rice to separate the grains. Serve it as a side dish or as a base for other dishes.</ul></p>
